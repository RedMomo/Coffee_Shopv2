# Emotional Support Coffee, v2.0

This is the backend for a second version of a basic e-commerce coffee shop, meant to solidify my react-rails knowledge. It is a RESTful API made for use with the react app, coffee-shopv2. 

## Features

This application will have the following features in the backend:

1. A fully seeded database with a variety of information types, including strings, integers, and booleans. The database will include:
    a. Coffees
    b. Additional information about the coffee processes
    c. Users (admins and non-admins)
2. Verifications to ensure consistent data.
3. Multiple tables with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
4. Endpoints for full-CRUD capabilities. 
5. Authentication for login capabilities.
